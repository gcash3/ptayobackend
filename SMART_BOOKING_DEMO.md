## üîß **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
cd parktayo-backend
npm install

# Add environment variable for weather API (optional)
echo "WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key" >> .env

# Start server
npm start
```

### 2. Test Smart Booking API
```bash
# Test analysis endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/bookings/analyze-smart \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "parkingSpaceId": "PARKING_SPACE_ID",
    "userCurrentLocation": {
      "latitude": 14.6022,
      "longitude": 120.9897
    },
    "vehicleId": "VEHICLE_ID"
  }'
```

### 3. Flutter Integration
```dart
// In your parking space detail screen
import 'package:your_app/widgets/smart_booking_widget.dart';

// Add to your widget
SmartBookingWidget(
  parkingLocation: selectedParkingSpace,
  userCurrentLocation: currentUserLocation,
  selectedVehicle: userVehicle,
)
```

## üìä **Algorithm Performance Metrics**

### Dynamic Buffer Calculation
```
Base Buffer: 30 minutes
+ Traffic Delay: 0-60 minutes (from Google Maps API)
+ User Reliability: 0-15 minutes (based on history)
+ Time of Day: 5-15 minutes (rush hour penalty)
+ Weather: 0-20 minutes (rain/storm impact)
+ Route Complexity: 0-15 minutes (distance-based)
= Total Buffer: 30-120 minutes (capped)
```

### Confidence Scoring
```
Traffic Confidence (25%): Based on real-time data quality
User Reliability (30%): Historical arrival accuracy
Route Complexity (20%): Distance and turns
Buffer Adequacy (15%): Ratio of buffer to travel time
Time Reliability (10%): Peak vs off-peak hours
= Overall Confidence: 0-100%
```

### Smart Prediction Features
```
- User lateness patterns by time of day
- Traffic condition impact on user behavior
- Route complexity preference learning
- Adaptive buffer time based on user performance
- Reliability score evolution over time
```
